Nabi(나비) is a Telegram Bot that tracks the length of study for your assignments and studies. Built upon the Telegram API for user messaging and console communication. Uses Node NLP (Natural Language Processing)—specificially the Naive Bayes classifier—to train the bot’s response based on custom classifying JSON text data. Nabi's main custom built-in method is `/pomodoro` where users can personally name and start a 25-minute study session.
